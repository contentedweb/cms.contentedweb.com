The default site comes with a number of pages setup:

 These pages serve certain purposes, as described here:

## Homepage

This the page displayed when you visit the root of your site. It includes, below the content you add via Forestry, the last 20 posts on your site. This is hardcoded and can't be changed at the moment as this is meant to be template for a blogging site.
