## Pages

The default site comes with a number of pages setup:

![](/assets/images/site-overview-1.png)

These pages serve certain purposes, as described here:

### Homepage

This the page displayed when you visit the root of your site. It includes, below the content you add via Forestry, the last 20 posts on your site. This is hardcoded and can't be changed at the moment as this is meant to be template for a blogging site.

### Archive

This page contains a pageable list of all the posts on the blog. By default it also contains a list to a page of [all the posts on the site grouped by year](/archive/all-posts/) and a page with a [clickable link of tags use on the blog](/archive/tags/). This page is configured to appear in the header menu. 

### Another Page

A blank page serving as an example standard page in the blog.

### Accessibility Statement

It is good practice for all sites to have an [accessibility statement](/pages/accessibility/), as this can help persons with disabilities get around your site. The template is by default fully accessible and the statement reflects that.

### About this site

This is a page on which you can describe [what your site is about](/pages/about/). It appears in the header menu.

### 404.md

This is the page that appears when a user visits a page that doesn't exist. It is [the error page](/pages/404/).

## Page settings

There a few settings you can configure when editing a page:

### Title

This is the title of the page and appears just before the content you create for the page.

### Menu Location 

This drop down enables you to place the page in preconfigured menus. Currently there are three options:

* none - page does not appear in a menu
* top - page appears in the header menu
* bottom - page appears in the footer menu

### Menu

If you configure the page to appear in a menu you can modify how it appears there. This is done in the menu sub-setting:

![](/assets/images/site-overview-3.png)

#### Menu - Title

This defines the name of the page in the menu. Use this if the page has a long title, but you want something shorter to appear in the menu

#### Menu - Order

This defines the location of the page within the menu. Lower numbers appear further to the left, higher numbers further to the right in the menu. It is good practice to use intervals of 10 so that you can add pages in between others without having to change modify this setting on all pages in the menu.
