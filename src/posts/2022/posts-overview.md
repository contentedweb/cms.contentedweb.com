## Posts

You can create and edit blog posts by going to "Posts" in the left hand menu:

Here you can create a new post directly in the Posts folder, or browse to a sub-folder and create the post there. You can also create new folders on this screen.

You could also add month sub-folders if you create many posts.

When you create a new post, you will see the following screen:
